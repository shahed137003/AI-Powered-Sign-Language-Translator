## 🧩 Data Format

Each sample is labeled with a **single gloss**.
The dataset is compatible with feature-based pipelines such as:

* Hand landmarks
* Face landmarks
* Pose landmarks
* Multimodal landmark fusion

---

## 🎯 Intended Use

This dataset is well-suited for:

* CNN-based classifiers
* LSTM / BiLSTM temporal models
* Transformer-based architectures
* Sliding window inference
* Real-time webcam sign recognition systems

Due to its size, it is **not intended for large-scale commercial training**, but it performs well in **controlled research, academic, and prototyping environments**.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

* Small dataset size
* Limited vocabulary (150 glosses)
* Isolated gloss dataset (not continuous sentence-level translation)
* Some repeated semantic concepts across categories (e.g., “sleep”, “more”, “drink”)
