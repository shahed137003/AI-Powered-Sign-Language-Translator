# 📘 Sign Language Gloss Dataset (147 Glosses)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a **small-scale Sign Language Gloss Dataset** with **147 commonly used glosses**.
The dataset is designed for **sign language recognition (SLR)** tasks and is especially suitable for:

- Prototyping deep learning models  
- Real-time sign language recognition experiments  
- Low-resource and small-dataset research scenarios  

The glosses focus on **everyday vocabulary** to ensure practical usability and semantic clarity.

## 🧩 Data Format
Each sample is labeled with a **single gloss**.
The dataset is intended to be used with feature-based pipelines such as:

- Hand landmarks  
- Face landmarks  
- Pose landmarks  




---

## 🎯 Intended Use
This dataset is well-suited for:
- CNN / LSTM / Transformer-based classifiers  
- Sliding window or frame-based inference  
- Real-time webcam sign recognition systems  

Due to its size, it is **not intended for large-scale commercial training**, but excels in **controlled research and educational settings**.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Small dataset size  
- Limited vocabulary (147 glosses)  
- Not suitable for continuous sentence-level translation  

---

## 📚 Source & Inspiration
The gloss list is inspired by **commonly used everyday signs**, similar to introductory ASL vocabulary resources such as Lifeprint.

---

## 🤝 Usage
This dataset is intended for **research and educational purposes only**.
