Raw Data Pipeline (Summary)
Temporal Interpolation: The code uses linear interpolation to "stretch" or "squeeze" every raw sequence into exactly 157 frames. This ensures the raw data matches the fixed input requirements of the model architecture.

Dimensional Alignment: It trims raw features to a fixed 438-dimension vector, stripping away extra noise so the model receives a clean, consistent data shape.

Adaptive-Padding: Within the TCN blocks, the code uses adaptive-padding based on the dilation factor. This keeps the data length consistent as it moves through the layers, preventing the model from "losing" information at the edges of the sign.

Adaptive Learning: The training process uses the AdamW optimizer, which automatically adjusts the learning rate for each parameter. This "adaptive" approach allows the model to find the best weights quickly, reaching 85.46% accuracy on raw, uncleaned data.
